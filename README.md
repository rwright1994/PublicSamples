# Public Samples
<h3>Web Development</h3> <hr/>
<p></p>All files are currently a work in progress for other applications. One application is for a project that has the potential to be commercialized if the applciation meets quality standards set by the professor and only includes parts I have worked on. The main idea of the application is centralized around Healthcare services. The other set of JSX files are for a personal project related to a business website that may be used to provide specialized services in cybersecurity & IT. Both are being developed using the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS ReactJS and Node.js) stack as well as TailwindCSS. The miscellaneous files are random samples of either small projects or assignments.</p>
